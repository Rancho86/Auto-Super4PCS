Super4PCS-V1.1.2
======================
### Purpose of this release
Stabilizing building process and source code, and improve compatibility with modern CMake before use in other contexts (wrappers to other libraries, Meshlab plugin, etc...):
 * Add a Super4PCS CMake package exporting the libraries
 * Improve testing (enable testing on windows + test library linking)

### Changelog
 - Improve installation process
    - Install headers db3457fa4f422ed6b7073ea3d59cc70d7888fecb 7211d7640635dc2fb3592c768178e9a060a9a808
    - Add proper cmake package 9b92ebbfe6ce08535f1c21f39eeb26f248f14916. Check instructions here: https://github.com/nmellado/Super4PCS/wiki/Compilation#usage
    - Update CMake minimal version to 3.3 aa21804df523554f66bcbcee8ba8d248aedba584
 - API
    - Refactor main namespace name as `GlobalRegistration` 036972d4ea7f5c304f6a04c690dfd789b920c656 ba79cae738e8bac8e412971c5875e316fbc558e8
    - Clean `match4pcsBase` API: keep only `ComputeTransformation` as public method (+ getters), and mark other internal methods as protected. 
Consequence of this change: the test applications will have to create local classes inheriting from `match4pcsBase` to allow access to these internal routines.  db3d7a06f48900f96a9af9a9fd657993fbe38806
 - Continuous Integration
    - Update Travis script to cope for new cmake minimal version aa21804df523554f66bcbcee8ba8d248aedba584 f9b654dfd294259b9837628d2286f72660c70a9b 43b23f6ff29d6112dc7afc9bd1e7e5775063cb9c f185cfcc48d8eba5183944779449225c493d6e0d 57aa88896510c257846b434db09c26f37a58f07a 4b78a1798113d2f02a16994610bb8ba59226ab2d
    - Add new test compiling and running an external application and linking against the Super4PCS library 75671cefddf2b4535cbb1f998a3080090bfaf1f2
    - [windows] Enable testing (release only, due to bad performances in debug -> hitting timeout)
    - [windows] Remove support for 32 bits builds 
 - Other fixes and improvements
    - Remove compilation warnings in IO module (not that this module is not safer than before, but just quiet) 93e9fbf0ea6b5976fbf24487480725614e708ebd c8ad84e0460e0fc8efe8a98b169118590c8fd662

    - Add missing file in CMake project (`match4pcsBase.hpp` was not visible in IDEs) 65b8156a8af8cb885a75c31aacade89f099d6fc6
    - Change `TransformVisitor` default behavior d2048b5534d528df5abb2d4f5c816cf2d462a99a

Super4PCS-V1.1.1
======================
Minor release update including:
 - fixes in the deployment system and 
 - fix a compilation error when enabling timings, authored by @xinkang 

Super4PCS-V1.1.0
======================
This release introduces new code structure allowing use as an actual library.

 - Build system
   - Add install target in cmake
   - Save binaries compiled by AppVeyor integration system as Artifacts
 - Demos, scripts and assets
   - assets are now added to the install folder, including downloaded datasets
   - demo scripts have been updated to work directly after installation. Windows batch scripts have been added.
 - Dependencies
   - Chealpix dependency is marked as deprecated: it slows down the approach and reduce it's robustness. Consequently, Chealpix is still built in CI but not tested.
 - Devel
   - Update include directive relatively to super4pcs root dir.
   - Add silent mode in matcher to avoid unwanted logging on standard output. This is implemented by adding a visitor in the matcher main loop, and set it as a logger in the Super4pcs main app.

Super4PCS-V1.0.0-alpha
======================


 - Dependencies:
   - remove ANN dependency,
   - remove dependency to Chealpix. Can be controlled by the option SUPER4PCS_USE_CHEALPIX. This options will be available for some time for experiment purposes. During this time, Chealpix and Cfitsio files will still be shipped with Super4PCS source code.
   - OpenCV is required only to load meshes textures. This dependency can be removed by switching option IO_USE_OPENCV to FALSE,
 - remove duplicate code between 4PCS and Super4PCS,
 - clean code structure,
 - demo dataset + run script added


This release has been tested on:
    Debian 4.9.30-1
        clang version 3.8.1-24
        gcc version 6.3.0 20170516
    Microsoft Windows 10
        VS 2017

This release fixes issues 34 and 29.
